<p></p><h2>Using Google Analytics</h2>
<h3>Type and purpose of the processing</h3>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA (hereinafter: 'Google'). Google Analytics uses so-called 'cookies', i.e. text files that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is typically transmitted to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. However, due to the activation of IP anonymisation on these websites, your IP address will be truncated beforehand by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the U.S. and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, summarise reports on website activities and provide other services related to website and Internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transferred from your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.</p>
<p>The data processing purposes are the website-use analysis and the summary of reports on activities on the website. Based on the use of the website and the Internet, other related services will be provided.</p>
<h3>Legal basis</h3>
<p>The processing of the data occurs on the basis of the user's consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 (a) GDPR).</p>
<h3>Recipients</h3>
<p>The recipient of the data is Google as the processor. For this, we have entered into the corresponding data-processing contract with Google.</p>
<h3>Retention period</h3>
<p>The deletion of the data occurs as soon as they are no longer necessary for our recording-keeping purposes.</p>
<h3>Third country transfers</h3>
<p>Google processes your data in the United States of America and is subject to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</a>. </p>
<h3>Mandatory or required provision</h3>
<p>The provision of your personal data is voluntary, based solely on your consent. If you prevent access, this can lead to functional limitations on the website.</p>
<h3>Revocation of consent</h3>
<p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting in your browser software; however, please note that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this website in their entirety. Furthermore, you can prevent the collected data generated by the cookie and the data related to your use of the website (including your IP address) being transmitted to Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, or as an alternative to the browser add-on, you can prevent tracking by Google Analytics on our web pages <a title="Google Analytics Opt-Out-Cookie setzen" onclick="gaOptout();alert(&#39;Google Analytics is deactivated&#39;);" href="https://florian-moehle.de/policy.html#">by clicking this link</a>, which will install an opt-out cookie on your device. This will prevent data collection by Google Analytics for this website and for this browser in the future, as long as the cookie remains installed in your browser.</p>
<h3>Profiling</h3>
<p>With the assistance of the tracking tool Google Analytics, the browsing behaviour of the website visitors can be evaluated and their respective interests can be analysed. For this analysis, we create a pseudonymous user profile.</p>
<p></p><h2>Using script libraries (Google Webfonts)</h2>
<h3>Type and purpose of the processing</h3>
<p>In order to present our content correctly and graphically appealing across all browsers, we use 'Google Webfonts' from Google LLC (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, hereinafter 'Google') to display fonts on this website.</p>
<p>You'll find the data protection guidelines of the library operator Google here: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a></p>
<h3>Legal basis</h3>
<p>Your consent is the legal basis for the integration of Google Webfonts and the associated data transfer to Google (Art. 6 Para. 1 (a) GDPR).</p>
<h3>Recipients</h3>
<p>The use of script libraries or font libraries automatically triggers a connection to the operator of the library. It is theoretically possible - but currently also unclear whether and to what end - that the operator, in this case Google, will collect data.</p>
<h3>Retention period</h3>
<p>We do not collect any personal data via the integration of Google Webfonts.</p>
<p>You'll find additional information on Google Webfonts at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
<h3>Third country transfers</h3>
<p>Google processes your data in the United States of America and is subject to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</a>.</p>
<h3>Mandatory or required provision</h3>
<p>The provision of your personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, the correct presentation of standard-fonts content is not possible without this provision.</p>
<h3>Revocation of consent</h3>
<p>The programming language JavaScript is regularly used to display content. Thus, you can opt out of the data processing by disabling JavaScript execution in your browser or by installing a JavaScript blocker. Please note that this may result in functional limitations on the website.</p>
<p></p><h2>SSL encryption</h2>
<p>To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption methods (such as SSL) via HTTPS.</p>
<p></p><h2>Revision of our privacy policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy so that it always complies with current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the privacy policy, e.g. when introducing new services. Your next visit will be subject to the new privacy policy.</p>
